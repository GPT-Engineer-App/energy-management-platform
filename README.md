# energy-management-platform

A plattform supplying the following user journeys: Customer Journey	Description	Workflow Details
1. Initial Setup & Onboarding	Users set up their account and integrate existing energy systems with the EMS tool.	- User creates an account.<br>- User inputs system details (e.g., device types, locations).<br>- System guides user through integration steps, automatically detecting compatible devices.
2. Real-Time Monitoring	Users monitor energy consumption in real-time across various devices and systems.	- Dashboard displays live energy usage data.<br>- Users can select devices/systems to view detailed consumption patterns.<br>- Data is refreshed at regular intervals (e.g., every minute).
3. Energy Usage Analysis	Users access detailed analyses and reports on their energy usage, identifying trends and inefficiencies.	- System aggregates data to present daily, weekly, and monthly reports.<br>- Analytics feature highlights inefficiencies and suggests optimizations.<br>- Users can customize reports based on specific criteria (e.g., time period, device).
4. Automated Alerts & Notifications	Users receive automated alerts for abnormal energy usage or when predefined thresholds are exceeded.	- Users set thresholds for energy consumption.<br>- System monitors consumption and sends alerts via email/SMS when thresholds are exceeded.<br>- Alert details include time, device/system, and suggested actions.
5. Energy Optimization Recommendations	Based on analysis, the system provides users with recommendations for reducing energy consumption and costs.	- System uses AI to analyze usage patterns and identify savings opportunities.<br>- Recommendations are presented within the tool, with options for automated implementation or user review.<br>- Users can track the impact of implemented recommendations on their energy usage and costs.
6. Regulatory Compliance Reporting	Users generate compliance reports for energy usage and sustainability efforts to meet regulatory requirements.	- Pre-defined report templates align with common regulatory standards.<br>- Users input necessary data, and the system compiles it into compliant reports.<br>- Reports can be exported in multiple formats (PDF, Excel) for submission to regulatory bodies.
7. System Integration & Expansion	Users integrate new devices or systems into the EMS tool as their energy management needs evolve.	- Integration wizard assists in adding new devices/systems.<br>- System checks for compatibility and provides step-by-step guidance.<br>- Users can manage and monitor newly integrated devices alongside existing ones in the dashboard.
8. User Feedback & Support	Users provide feedback on the tool and access support for issues or questions.	- In-tool feedback form for users to submit suggestions or report issues.<br>- Knowledge base and FAQ section for self-service support.<br>- Chatbot or live support option for direct assistance.
